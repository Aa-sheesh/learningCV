## Working

### Step 1 : Feature Extraction

- The system scrutinizes the incoming visual data to identify and isolate significant visual elements, such as edges, shapes, textures, and patterns.
- These features are critical because they serve as the building blocks for the subsequent stages of analysis.
- To facilitate computer processing, these identified features are translated into numerical representations, effectively converting the visual information into a format that machines can comprehend and manipulate more efficiently.

### Step 2 : Object Detection

- Systemâ€™s algorithms work to identify and locate specific objects or entities within the images.

### Step 3 : Image Classification

- Image classification involves categorizing entire images into predefined classes or categories. This is where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) come into play.

### Step 4 : Object Tracking

- It involves the ability to monitor and trace the movement of objects as they traverse through consecutive frames of a video.

### Step 5 : Semantic Segmentation

- Labeling each and every pixel within an image with its respective category.

## Key Features of CV
